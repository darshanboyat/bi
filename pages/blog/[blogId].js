                                                First and foremost, you need to make sure your team is aligned with a
                                                shared vision. Without this alignment, everyone is working in silos and
                                                everything takes longer than necessary because people arenâ€™t talking to
                                                each other. A good leader knows how to create this alignment by
                                                communicating clearly about where he wants the product and the team to
                                                go.

                                                Another important rule is creating the right product culture and

                                                and incentives, but then steps back so that everyone can do what they do

                                                Embedded and centralized approaches are combined here. The developers
                                                are still integrated into specific teams, but they also report to a head
                                                of product development who aims to unify the approach and align
                                                everyone. Flexibility can be very valuable, but it can also cause wires
                                                to be crossed when team members aren't sure who should report to and who
